# Fearless Tech: Purple Cow Project üíú

## About

This is a trial project for Fearless Tech that utilizes the CountAPI to retrieve and track counts on the webpage's button

---

## How to Use üëÄ

- Clone the git repository to your local machine

- Open the project's directory in a command line like Terminal on Mac

- Enter the following command to install dependencies and start the app:

```
npm start
```

This will indicate that the server is "listening on port 3000"

- Open localhost:3000 on your browser to use the app

---

## Future Improvements üî®

- This application is only just passed MVP form, so the styling and overall appearance would be improved if given more time

- Dockerization of the app would offer a runtime-environment to ensure consistency across various machines & a one-click start up for the application

- I wanted to bundle this application with Parcel, which is an alternative to webpack/babel, however I kept getting an error so for the sake of time I used webpack/babel

---

## To change the localhost Port number 3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£

- Open server.js in the main directory of the repository

- Change the value of port on line 20

- Stop the server from listening and run "npm start" again to see the port change
